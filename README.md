Krishi Mitra – Your Smart Farming Companion
💡 Problem

Small farmers lose up to 40 % of their yield because they:

Don’t know which crop suits their local soil & weather

Can’t identify pests early

Lack timely advice on irrigation and fertilizers

Have low literacy and limited digital access

🚀 Solution: AgriSathi (AI + Voice + Vision)

A simple, voice-enabled AI web/app platform that helps farmers:

Chat or Talk with an AI in their local language to get instant, personalized advice.

Know what to plant — the app suggests the best crop based on their location, soil, and weather.

Detect pests early — farmers click a photo of the crop, and AI identifies the pest and gives treatment advice.

Get irrigation & fertilizer reminders (automated notifications or voice alerts).
