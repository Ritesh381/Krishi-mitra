# 🌾 KRISHI-MITRA: Empowering Farmers with Intelligent, Voice-Driven Growth

  **A Vercel Hackathon Project built in 12 hours at Scaler School of Technology, Bengaluru.**

  **Built by:** Ritesh, Smit, Jenil, Somyajit

  Krishi-Mitra is a comprehensive, AI-powered farming support platform designed to provide small farmers with personalized, timely, and accessible agricultural advice, addressing major causes of yield loss.

  ## 💡 The Problem

  Small farmers (owning **<2 hectares**) lose an estimated **30–40% of their yield** annually due to preventable issues, leading to debt and reduced food availability.

  The primary bottlenecks are:

  1. **Inadequate Local Advice:** Generic information doesn't match specific local soil, weather, and planting times.

  2. **Delayed Intervention:** Inability to identify and treat pests/diseases early.

  3. **Digital Barrier:** High literacy rates and limited access to conventional digital tools.

  ## 🚀 The Solution: Krishi-Mitra (AI + Voice + Vision)

  Krishi-Mitra acts as a **simple, voice-enabled AI companion** that helps farmers overcome these barriers by providing hyper-localized, real-time advice.

  | Feature | Purpose | Key Differentiator |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | 🗣️ **AI Voice + Text Chat** | Overcomes literacy and access barriers. | **Persistent, Multilingual Chat Sessions.** |
  | 🌾 **Localized Crop Suggestion** | Suggests the optimal crop based on farm inputs. | **95% Confidence-rated Recommendations** with full planting calendar. |
  | 🐛 **Pest Detection via Image** | Instant disease diagnosis and treatment plan. | Provides **Simple & Cheap Treatment** advice using readily available resources. |
  | 💧 **Irrigation Planner** | Smart scheduling based on crop and weather data. | Delivers **"Postpone Irrigation"** and **"Immediate Irrigation"** alerts. |
  | 📊 **Market Prices** | Real-time market trends. | Live data from **142 Active Mandis** with customizable Price Alerts. |

  ## ✨ Live Feature Showcase

  The Krishi-Mitra dashboard provides a central hub for all farm tools, integrating data from all systems to provide actionable insights at a glance.

  1. **AI Assistant (Voice & Chat):**

     * Farmers can communicate in their preferred local language via voice or text.

     * The chat system is **persistent**, allowing farmers to review past advice and maintain continuous context across sessions.

     * *Screenshot evidence: Chat Sessions with multilingual response (Hindi).*

  2. **Crop Suggestions:**

     * Based on detailed farmer inputs (Location, Soil Type, Water Source, Budget), the system delivers top crop recommendations.

     * Recommendations include Key Details (Planting Time, Water Needs, Profit Estimate) and a dynamic Planting Calendar.

     * *Screenshot evidence: Analysis Results with 95% Confidence and Okra as the Top Recommendation.*

  3. **Pest Detection:**

     * Using vision AI, farmers upload a photo of a diseased plant part.

     * The system immediately provides a high-confidence diagnosis, observed symptoms, and a **simple, affordable treatment plan** (e.g., using rusty iron pieces for 'Yellow Leaf Sickness').

     * *Screenshot evidence: Detection Results (Confidence 90%) for 'Yellow Leaf Sickness' and treatment steps.*

  4. **Weather Insights & Alerts:**

     * Provides comprehensive weather analysis (Humidity, UV Index, Soil Temp) and proactive Agricultural Alerts.

     * Alerts, such as "Heavy Rainfall Expected" or "Postpone Irrigation," help prevent crop damage and resource waste.

     * *Screenshot evidence: 7-Day Forecast with Agricultural Alerts.*

  5. **Irrigation Planner:**

     * Tracks current **Soil Moisture (45%)** and provides smart recommendations (e.g., *Field 1 needs immediate irrigation*).

     * Manages scheduled irrigation cycles (Time, Duration, Water Amount) and dynamically updates based on the rain forecast.

     * *Screenshot evidence: Irrigation Schedules for Wheat, Tomato, and Maize with efficiency scores.*
